-HOW TO SET UP THE AI FILES-
(These AI files are to be used in YGO 1.033)

1. Extract the files; open the folder for ai. Add Gamemaster.ai to where you find ai and cheating.ai.

2.Locate folder in AI(in game) that is called deck; this is where you put the decks i have worked on for the ai. Currently they are Marik, Yamiyugi, Rapheal and Rare Hunter Strings. Grab the files mentioned and place them in that location.

3. Open a new game, select ai / then choose Gamemaster.ai to handler them. Try them out and let me know what you think.
